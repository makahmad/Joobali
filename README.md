# What is Joobali?
Joobali is creating an innovative platform that will revolutionize the child care industry.  Most child care businesses are very small businesses (90%) and have few tools at their disposal to help them compete in an increasingly digital environment.  Joobali is changing that by creating a one stop shop for innovative childcare solutions. Joobali helps child care providers manage and market their businesses.  Joobali helps parents understand their real time child care options.  Think Airbnb, but for small child care business owners, with online tools that help providers manage short and long-term child care relationships (e.g. enrollment, scheduling, payments).
